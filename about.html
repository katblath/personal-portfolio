        >Is this the real life<br />
        Is this just fantasy<br />
        Caught in a landslide<br />
        No escape from reality<br />
        <br />
        Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br />
        I'm just a poor boy, (oooh, poor boy), I need no sympathy<br />
        Because I'm easy come, easy go<br />
        Little high, little low<br />
        Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me - to me<br />
        <br />
        Mama, just killed a man<br />
        Put a gun against his head<br />
        Pulled my trigger now he's dead<br />
        Mama, life had just begun<br />
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br />
        <br />
        Mama, oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br />
        Didn't mean to make you cry<br />
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br />
        Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br />
        <br />
        Too late, my time has come<br />
        Sends shivers down my spine<br />
        Body's aching all the time<br />
        Goodbye everybody, I've got to go<br />
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />
        <br />
        Mama, oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br />
        (Anyway the wind blows)<br />
        I don't want to die (oooohhh)<br />
        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all (oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh,
        oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh)<br />
        <br />
        I see a little silhouetto of a man<br />
        Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango?<br />
        Thunderbolts and lightning - very, very frightening me<br />
        Gallileo, gallileo<br />
        Gallileo, gallileo<br />
        Gallileo, figaro - magnifico-o-o-o-oh<br />
        I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br />
        He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br />
        Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br />
        <br />
        Easy come, easy go, will you let me go<br />
        Bismillah! No - we will not let you go, let him go<br />
        Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go<br />
        Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go<br />
        Will not let you go, let me go<br />
        Never, never, never, never, never (never let you go)<br />
        Never let me go-o-o-o-oh<br />
        No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br />
        Oh, mama mia, mama mia<br />
        Mama mia let me go<br />
        Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br />
        <br />
        So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br />
        So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br />
        Oh, baby, can't do this to me baby<br />
        Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here<br />
        <br />
        Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, oooh yeah, oooh yeah<br />
        <br />
        Nothing really matters<br />
        Anyone can see<br />
        Nothing really matters <br />
        Nothing really matters to me<br />
        <br />
        Anyway the wind blows</span
